👋 Hello, world! Welcome to my GitHub! I'm Lohit, an SRE 💼, with a diverse history in network architecture, distributed systems, and reliability engineering. I’m a coding enthusiast who breathes automation, cloud technologies, and all things tech! 🚀

🔭 I’m currently working on managing Google Cloud Platform resources using Terraform, on display in my [TF-Workspace](https://github.com/iamlohit/TF-Workspace) repo ☁️. At the same time, I'm developing automated CI/CD workflows in the exciting domain of GitHub's DevOps service, as seen in my [github_actions](https://github.com/iamlohit/github_actions) repository 🔧.

🌱 I’m presently learning and exploring the MERN stack in my [Full-Stack-Journey](https://github.com/iamlohit/Full-Stack-Journey) repository, and also immersing myself in Python 🐍 in the [100daysofPython](https://github.com/iamlohit/100daysofPython) project.

👯 I’m always eager to collaborate on intriguing projects, especially those involving automation or cloud technologies. Whether it's a hobby project or an industrial application, I'm all in for code-driven collaborations!

🤔 I’m actively seeking help and advice in system design, a domain I'm venturing into with the help of the [system-design-primer](https://github.com/iamlohit/system-design-primer) 💡. Any expertise, resources, or collaborations in this field are most welcome!

💬 Don't hesitate to ask me about anything from network engineering to SRE practices, or from Python scripting to cloud provisioning. If it's tech-related, I'm all ears and ready to share my knowledge!

📫 How to reach me: The best way is to leave me a message here on GitHub, or connect with me through my personal website, [iamlohit.github.io](https://iamlohit.github.io) 📮.

⚡ Fun fact: My fascination with tech took a serious turn after watching the concept of a "fire sale" in Die Hard 4. That, along with my early experiences of building computers for gaming parlours while in school, cemented my love for tech! 🖥️🎮

In this tech world, let's keep learning, keep coding, and keep growing together! 🌱👨‍💻🚀
